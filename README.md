## 📓 Notebooks

### Llama3 (8B) - Ollama
**File**: `nb/Llama3_(8B)-Ollama.ipynb`

Implementation and experimentation with Meta's Llama 3 (8B parameter) model using Ollama framework.

**Topics covered:**
- Llama 3 model setup and configuration
- Ollama integration
- LLM inference and experimentation
- Performance optimization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab account
- Required Python packages (specified in notebooks)

### Running Notebooks

#### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Click on the notebook file in the `nb/` directory
2. Click "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook

#### Option 2: Local Jupyter
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/joffroy59/IA-Colab.git
cd IA-Colab

# Install Jupyter (if not already installed)
pip install jupyter

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Navigate to nb/ folder and open desired notebook
```
